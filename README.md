## Original Question
Encryption is an integral part of cybersecurity and security in general, being used to hide information through some form of obfuscation of the original information. Though modern techniques utilize far more complex forms of encryption, the Playfair Cipher is still effective at masking information and presents a difficult
problem to crack without its key. The Playfair Cipher was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone and uses symmetric encryption. This technique takes pairs of letters (often referred to as bigrams or digrams) and encrypts them. This creates a more difficult encyption than simple substitution ciphers which are vulnerable to frequency analysis. The Playfair Cipher uses a 5-by-5 table that contains either a keyword or phrase which acts as the encryption key.

In this assignment, you will execute Playfair Cipher encryption using queues. These will be utilized to transform a sentence or phrase submitted by the user into bigrams. Once these bigrams are created, the set will be encrypted based off a Playfair Cipher key table. The final product will be presented to the user. The user can also request decryptions based off the key used by the current iteration of the program.
